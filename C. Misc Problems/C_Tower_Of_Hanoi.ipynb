    "The Tower of Hanoi is like a puzzle game where you have three rods and a bunch of disks of different sizes. The goal is to move all the disks from one rod to another, but you can't place a bigger disk on top of a smaller one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the basic rules:\n",
    "- You can only move one disk at a time.\n",
    "- You can move the top disk from any rod to another rod.\n",
    "- You can't put a bigger disk on top of a smaller one.\n"
